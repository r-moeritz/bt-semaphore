# bt-semaphore

A simple semaphore class for bordeaux-threads inspired by SBCL's semaphore.

## Usage

### Installation

```
cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
git clone https://github.com/ralph-moeritz/bt-semaphore
```

### Usage

There are only six functions of interest at the moment:

 - `make-semaphore` creates a semaphore instance
 - `semaphore-count` returns the current count of the semaphore
 - `wait-on-semaphore` blocks until the semaphore can be decremented (ie. its
   count > 0)
 - `signal-semaphore` increments the semaphore & wakes any threads blocked by a
   call to `wait-on-semaphore`
 - `semaphore-name` is an accessor for the semaphore's name slot
 - `try-semaphore` decrements the semaphore without blocking

To illustrate, here's a tiny example:

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload 'bt-semaphore)

(defvar sem (bt-semaphore:make-semaphore))
(defvar lock (bt-semaphore:make-lock))
(defvar num 0)

;; Create 10 threads, each waiting on the semaphore.
(dotimes (_ 10)
  (bordeaux-threads:make-thread
   (lambda ()
     (bt-semaphore:wait-on-semaphore sem)
     (bordeaux-threads:with-lock-held (lock)
       (incf num)))))

;; Wake 5 of them.
(bt-semaphore:signal-semaphore sem 5)

(princ num) ;; prints 5
```

## Status

The basics are done. It's not yet a replacement for `SB-THREAD:SEMAPHORE`, but
we're getting there.
