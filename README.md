# bt-semaphore

A simple semaphore class for bordeaux-threads inspired by SBCL's semaphore.

## Usage

### Installation

```
cd ~/quicklisp/local-projects
git clone https://github.com/ralph-moeritz/bt-semaphore
```

### Usage

There are only four functions of interest at the moment:

 - `make-semaphore` creates a semaphore instance
 - `semaphore-count` returns the current count of the semaphore
 - `wait-on-semaphore` blocks until the semaphore can be decremented (ie. its
   count > 0)
 - `signal-semaphore` increments the semaphore & wakes any threads blocked by a
   call to `wait-on-semaphore`

To illustrate, here's a tiny example:

```common-lisp
(ql:quickload 'bt-semaphore)

(defvar sem (bt-semaphore:make-semaphore))
(defvar num 0)

(bordeaux-threads:make-thread
          (lambda ()
            (bt-semaphore:wait-on-semaphore sem)
            (setf num 42)))

(bt-semaphore:signal-semaphore sem)

(princ num)
```

## Status

The basics are done but it's far from being a replacement for `bt-thread:semaphore`.
